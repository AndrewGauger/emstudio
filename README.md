#FreeTune

### Overview:

I suppose I should have some real documentation here on how to use the different features of FreeTune....


### Compiling:

#### Linux:

To compile, you need Qt > 4.7.0, including the declarative packages. Then just run the standard
qmake
make
from the command line and it should build and run via ./FreeTune

#### Windows:

I really can't support compiling on Windows. It's too much of a hassle and there are way too many variables and different
machine configurations to do any real support. If someone is interested in maintaining Windows binaries let me know and I'll
work through it with you, but it's too much of a mess to provide generla support. I'll handle compiling binaries for now.
